## Create a React Native Repo

```sh
npm install -g react-native-cli
```

Then `cd` to a place where you can make a new React Native project.

```sh
cd dev/projects/js
```

Then create a react native project:

```sh
react-native init MyApp
```

### What just happened?

Things to cover:

- What does `react-native-cli` do?
- How does a `package.json` work?
- What is this `node_modules` blackhole?

### The `ios` folder

- Show how it's a normal Xcode project
- Show how the RN view gets defined
