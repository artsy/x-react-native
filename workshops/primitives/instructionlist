Workshop instructions:

1) Get basic setup from GH
2) Yarn install
3) Yarn start
4) Run app from Xcode
5) Check that it's running

Phase 1:

Turn this into a proper and pretty list

Using:
- Buttons
- UILabels
- etc

Step 1:
Create a new component

BreadItem
- interface
- keep it empty
- then return <Text> to show that it stays the same

great

Now let's create the view structure
and put in the right props

done

Run

Now let's add the stylesheets

for Text
See text styling in action

introduce background colours and margins and padding

then add flexbox

then add images, rearrage the CSS

now the buttons

don't include surrounding view
show that it stretches, so put the view in the addbutton file

Then add final styling, get into flexbox-grow and ratios. show through coloured background images

wrap up the card, done. (add border if you want or not)

then we move on to add a recipe bit at the top. We open final folder, that contains some work already done. I point out that if people are curious
they can look in the source to see how overlays are done, but otherwise, we're going to make this flatlist horizontal.

step one horizontal=true
