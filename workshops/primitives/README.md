This workshops is a series of Xcode projects which take you through the process of creating a React Native project from
scratch.

> _We use basic view components to construct more complex user experiences on a daily basis. When moving to React
> Native, one might wonder… where’s my `UILabel`? `UIButton`, and good ol’ `UICollectionView`? This workshop covers a
> few of your every day components and how to style them using CSS._
